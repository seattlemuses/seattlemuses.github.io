<p class="info">
The development and implementation of our training program curriculum is being led 
by Christine Tsui, a veteran in the industry with over 25 years of experience.  She
is building on top of the foundation laid by Pennie Sangerman, our pilot trianing 
instructor.  Learn more about Christine on our <a href="about-team.html">team page</a>.

One of our priorities is ensuring that the curriculum is geared towards meeting the 
essential apparel manufacturing needs of local designers.  We will continue involving
designers in the further development of our curriculum to ensure we are trianing our 
students in relevant, needed skills.

The class is being designed specifically for low-income immigrants and refugees.  In 
partnership with Seattle-based service agencies, we address our students' unique challenges 
around limited English proficiency, lack of transportation, and need for childcare.
</p>
<p class="info">
Muses works with students lacking strong English fluency through covering industry-
relevant vocabulary and focusing on visual demonstrations over verbal communication.  
We are actively looking for a solution to help our students with transportation costs
and childcare. 
</p>
<p class="info">
Our goal is to create a space that makes students feel safe and supported. We strive 
for a classroom culture with strong interpersonal relationships and filled with 
laughter!

We will play an active role in connecting our students with employment opportunities.  Their career 
paths may include working for designers or manufacturing houses, starting their own business, or 
joining our own Muses production studio.
Our priority will be on ensuring fair living wages and good working conditions.

<h1>Our curriculum</h1>
<p class="info">
Our pilot program ran for 5 months total, ending in November 2013.  Currently, we are 
focusing on building our full training program launching in early 2015, which will cover the
following topics:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Measuring:</strong> Students will learn industry standards on working with varying fabrics,
  points of measures, and preparing a spec sheet.
</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<strong>Equipment, tools, and maintenance:</strong> Students will master operation of a variety of
industrial sewing machines and the use of commonly used tools in the design room and production
facility.  They will also gain experience in light machine maintenance and safety precautions.
</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<strong>Construction:</strong> Students will study commonly used stitches and their applications, as well 
as how to make a variety of seam types.
</li>
<p> 
</p>
<li> 
<strong>Production simulation:</strong> Outside of classroom instruction, students will work on 
projects that apply all the learned skills and techniques to an actual production lifecycle. 
Some of these projects will include working with local designers on their production needs.  Focus 
will be placed on quality and efficiency, while advancing students' skills, experience, and
confidence.
</li>
<p>
</p>
<li>
<strong>Vocabulary building:</strong> Every lecture will also include a segment teaching industry 
specific vocabulary.  As needed, additional ESL services will be provided.
