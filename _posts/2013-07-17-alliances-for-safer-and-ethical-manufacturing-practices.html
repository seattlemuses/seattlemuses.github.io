<p>Last April, thousand of workers died after the collapse of a Factory in Bangladesh. This tragic accident pushed North American and European retailers to work on drafting a factory safety pact. This pact is a five-year commitment to improve factories safety conditions for workers in Bangladesh. If some differences are still dividing US and European retailers, this agreement is a stepping stone toward safer and more responsible manufacturing practices. A recent article from <a href="http://qz.com/102528/here-are-the-differences-between-the-us-and-european-retailer-plans-to-make-bangladeshi-factories-safer/">Quartz</a> presents a visual explainer and a breakdown of how the two plans differ:</p>
