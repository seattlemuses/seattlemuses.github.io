On the clothes are attached pieces of paper on which sentences are written.  Each sentences express protest against [mass production](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production "Mass production") and mass consumption. The exhibit highlights issues on ethics and labor, stereotypes, ideals of beauty. Messages are short, clear and powerful. Overall, the Wing Luke Museum Exhibit "Fashion: workroom to runaway" offers an engaging and educative experience.
