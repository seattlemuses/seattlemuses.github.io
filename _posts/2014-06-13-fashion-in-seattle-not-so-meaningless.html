<p>Most of what we do in life is a consumption experience. We consume services, social experiences, media and material goods. How are these shopping experiences satisfying our lives?</p>

<p>Muses believes that ethical fashion can be fulfilling.<strong> Ethical Fashion reflects individuals' personal values and interests for environment, human rights and style. Ethical fashion dignifies work. Ethical fashion means connecting some of the world most marginalized artisans with fashion industry for mutual benefits. It guaranties fair wages, develops local creativity, fosters employment in the US and abroad, and helps reduce poverty by promoting fair trade initiatives and encouraging the creation of sustainable livelihoods. Making purchases that are true to our beliefs gives us an opportunity to do and feel good. </strong>The Fashion world does not only promote materialistic and superficial values; it gives a space in which communities can express their cultural heritage, social identity and beliefs. Fashion has the ability to seduce, amuse, shock or inspire. Go for a walk on a Friday evening in Seattle' s vibrating Capitol Hill's neighborhood and you will see how fashion reveals individuals' personalities. Fashion helps people escape from the ordinary, it is an art expression, it is beauty, and it is timeless.</p>

<p>Seattle is such a welcoming city for artists, artisans, designers, social consumers. Collaboratively with producers, social workers, educators, businesses we can help shape a more responsible industry, create interesting jobs and improve our consumption experiences.</p>

<p>The Ethical Fashion Initiative is not a charity. It facilitates dignified work at a fair wage. It does so by connecting some of the world’s most marginalised artisans in Africa and Haiti with the fashion industry’s top talents, for mutual benefit. It also works with upcoming designers in West Africa to promote local talent and increase export capacities of the region. In everything it does, the Ethical Fashion Initiative develops local creativity, fosters predominantly female employment and empowerment, promotes gender equality to reduce extreme poverty and increase the export capacities of the regions in which it operates. It also satisfies the fashion world’s wish to be more fair.</p>
<p>Here, being ethical means more than doing no harm. It means taking an active role in the reduction of poverty and the creation of sustainable livelihoods. It also means protecting and cleaning up the environment. The Ethical Fashion Initiative works directly with those living in slums and barren rural areas, with the aim of empowering them through quality work that minimises the negative impact on their surroundings.</p>
