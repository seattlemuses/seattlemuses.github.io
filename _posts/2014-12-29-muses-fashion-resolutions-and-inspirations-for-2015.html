<p>A new year is starting soon! 2014 was filled with beautiful new connections and great moments. As we head  into the New Year, Muses would like to share some of its <strong>fashion resolutions for 2015:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:#008080;">Buy only if you need it!</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#008080;">Celebrate the stories you wear, care for your clothes, recycle and fix them! Muses will be happy to help you fix your favorite clothes!</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#008080;">Think out of the box, consume and wear your clothes differently!</span></li>
</ol>
<p>This new year is also an opportunity for us to highlight Muses' sister organizations as well as innovative and sustainable fashion initiatives that we found the most inspiring in 2014.</p>
<h1><a href="http://www.empowermentplan.org/" target="_blank">#1 The empowerment plan</a></h1>
<p>The empowerment plan is <span class="color_8"> Detroit-based nonprofit organization dedicated to serving the homeless community. They mostly hire homeless parents from local shelters to become full-time seamstresses. These individuals manufacture a coat that transforms into a sleeping bag, which is then given out to homeless</span><span class="color_8"> people living on the streets at no cost to them.

<h1><a href="http://www.theopenarmsshop.com" target="_blank"><strong>#2 Open Arms</strong></a></h1>
<p>Open Arms is a non-profit social enterprise creating awareness that everyday choices can change the world. Open Arms is a USA-Made sustainable manufacturer empowering refugee women through living wage employment. See more here: http://www.theopenarmsshop.com/</p>

<h1><strong><span style="color:#993300;"><a href="http://www.intracen.org/itc/projects/ethical-fashion/the-initiative/#sthash.qCTQUsba.dpuf" target="_blank">#3 The ITC Ethical Fashion Initiative funded by United Nations</a></span></strong></h1>
<p>The Ethical Fashion Initiative is not a charity. It facilitates dignified work at a fair wage. It does so by connecting some of the world’s most marginalized artisans in Africa and Haiti with the fashion industry’s top talents, for mutual benefit. It also works with upcoming designers in West Africa to promote local talent and increase export capacities of the region. - See more at: http://www.intracen.org/itc/projects/ethical-fashion/the-initiative/#sthash.qCTQUsba.dpuf</p>
