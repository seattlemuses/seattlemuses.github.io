2014 is going to be a promising year! We would like to start this new year by thanking one of our supporters: the Fashion House [Prairie Underground!](http://www.prairieunderground.com/index.html) We thank Davora Lindner and Camilla Eckersley for their generous donation that will help Muses continue growing as an organization this year. We are so excited to have Seattle-based fashion designers supporting one of Muses' main mission: promoting responsible manufacturing practices and conscious consumption habits.

According to [Seattle Magazine](http://www.seattlemag.com/editors-choice-prairie-underground), Prairie Underground is one of the "brightest, most innovative and perhaps most economically successful brands to come out of Seattle in the last decade". You can find their line in more than 300 independent boutiques nationwide and online. Prairie Underground is using sustainable material, such as organic cotton and hemp, to create architectural coats, hoodies, dresses and tops. Their clothing line is feminine and elegant, yet practical. The team also managed to keep all their manufacturing done locally in Seattle!
