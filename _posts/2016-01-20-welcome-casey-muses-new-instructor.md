I was born and raised in Seattle. I started working in the corporate sector directly out of high school, eventually becoming a project manager in the tech industry. In 2009 I decided to turn my lifelong sewing hobby into a profession and enrolled in the New York Fashion Academy’s certificate program. I juggled work, school, and a variety of odd sewing jobs for a few years and decided to open my own work room after graduating from NYFA in 2013. My business has largely focused on creating editorial fashion, producing my own line of clothing, providing pattern- and sample-making to other independent designers, and teaching sewing/tailoring. I’m excited to work with Muses because I believe in the mission. I find the garment and textile industries to be very exploitative in many parts of the world and it’s inspiring to be part of a group of people doing something about it.

I don’t think I could list them all! My family is a tremendous inspiration. They impressed upon me the importance of hard work and dedication. Teaching is another one. Seeing a student’s face light up when gel with new content is indescribable. I also love the technical aspects of sewing and synthesizing solutions to design problems.
