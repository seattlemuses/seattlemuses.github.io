## Bellow Muses's first Studio. We liked our first sewing studio but we are now looking for a bigger space. We haven't found the ideal studio yet. We need your help!

### We are looking for a 900 sq ft to 1,500 sq ft working/industrial sewing space that could welcome 10 to 15 students. We will have industrial machines, cutting tables, roll of fabrics etc. We are looking for a space with natural light, clean and safe.

#### Here are our requirements:
+ **Space:** between 900 sq ft to 1500 sq ft
+ **Length of the lease:** 1 year preferred; 6-9 months negotiable
+ **Location accessibility:** Close to bus or light rail. South Seattle, anywhere from International District to Tukwila.
+ **Electricity/power:** We are going to use industrial machines (5/10 maximum), so we need a room with accessible outlets.
+ **Layout/lunch room:** It will be great to have access to sink and extra room for our students and staff to have lunch.
+ **Parking:** Access to parking (including street parking) for instructor and staff
+ **Storage:** Not necessary but would be a plus
