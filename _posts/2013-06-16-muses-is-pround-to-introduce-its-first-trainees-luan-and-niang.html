<p>Luan and Niang are originally from Burma and belong to the Chin community. They now live in Tukwila. Luan used to work as a tailor and dress maker. Before moving to the US, she spent several years in a Burmese refugee camp in India.  Niang learned how to sew from her mother. She stayed many years in Malaysia and moved to WA State 5 years ago. Both are very excited to start the Muses Training. The 2 month training will offer them the opportunity to improve their professional skills and upon graduation, Luan and Niang hope to find a fair-paid job that will allow them to gain further financial independence.  This pilot training is a bright new adventure for both them and the Muses team. We are proud and excited to have Luan and Niang as our first students!</p>
