<p>June 20th countries around the world celebrated the World Refugee day. Several European countries such as Germany, France, UK, Ireland organized umbrella marches in their capitals. Participants to the marches had to bring a white umbrella as a symbol of protection and as a reminder that European countries should stretch an umbrella over refugees fleeing persecution, war and violence.</p>
<p>According to the UNHCR, (UN Refugee Agency), there are over <strong>43.7 million</strong> refugees and internally displaced people around the world. In 2011, the <a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/about/mission.htm">Office of Refugee Resettlement</a> (ORR) and its partners served nearly 102,500 new arrivals. including 56,379 refugees. The U.S. receives refugees from more than 65 countries.</p>
<p>In its last newsletter ORR mentioned that, "<em>the highest number of overseas arrivals mirrored arrivals in the past few years, with Burmese (16,901) and Bhutanese (14,882) leading, followed by Cubans, Iraqis (9,415), Somalis (3,148), Iranians (2,024) and Eritreans (1,980)"</em> (source: <a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/press/2011_Year_End_Newsletter.htm">ORR newsletter 2011</a>).</p>
<p>The number of refugees is growing every year. While resettling in United Sates, refugees flee their camps with a dream in mind: accessing peace and safety. MUSES believes that all together, artists, designers, consumers, social advocates, we can join our talents and forces to help raise funds for implementing programs that facilitate the social, cultural and professional inclusion of newly arrived refugees.</p>
