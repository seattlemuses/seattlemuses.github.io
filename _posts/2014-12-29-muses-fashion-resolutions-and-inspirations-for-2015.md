A new year is starting soon! 2014 was filled with beautiful new connections and great moments. As we head into the New Year, Muses would like to share some of its **fashion resolutions for 2015:**

1. Buy only if you need it!
2. Celebrate the stories you wear, care for your clothes, recycle and fix them! Muses will be happy to help you fix your favorite clothes!
3. Think out of the box, consume and wear your clothes differently!

This new year is also an opportunity for us to highlight Muses' sister organizations as well as innovative and sustainable fashion initiatives that we found the most inspiring in 2014.

## [#1 The empowerment plan](http://www.empowermentplan.org/)

The empowerment plan is a Detroit-based nonprofit organization dedicated to serving the homeless community. They mostly hire homeless parents from local shelters to become full-time seamstresses. These individuals manufacture a coat that transforms into a sleeping bag, which is then given out to homeless people living on the streets at no cost to them.

## [#3 The ITC Ethical Fashion Initiative funded by United Nations](http://www.intracen.org/itc/projects/ethical-fashion/the-initiative/#sthash.qCTQUsba.dpuf)

The Ethical Fashion Initiative is not a charity. It facilitates dignified work at a fair wage. It does so by connecting some of the world's most marginalized artisans in Africa and Haiti with the fashion industry's top talents, for mutual benefit. It also works with upcoming designers in West Africa to promote local talent and increase export capacities of the region.
