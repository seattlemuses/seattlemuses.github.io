<p style="font-style:inherit;border:0;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;margin:0 0 1.75em;outline:0;padding:0;vertical-align:baseline;color:#444444;line-height:19.6875px;">Caitlin background is mostly in youth and young adult development with an emphasis on leadership, civic engagement, and using creativity and art to inspire social change. She graduated from Oberlin College in 2007 with a degree in Comparative American Studies. Caitlin is passionate about working with multi-cultural grassroots organizations which is why she is so excited to be working with Muses:  “<i style="border:0;font-family:inherit;font-weight:inherit;margin:0;outline:0;padding:0;vertical-align:baseline;">Most of my life I have used art and fashion as a form of self-expression, self-care, and social engagement. I believe that the manufacturing of clothes as well as the social statements that we make with what we wear is incredibly powerful. Muses is the perfect combination of my interests. Bringing together women from immigrant and refugee communities to train them in the garment industry combines my love of working with multi-cultural and undeserved communities, my passion for art and fashion, and my desire to impact the labor industry so that it is more accountable equitable</i>“.</p>
