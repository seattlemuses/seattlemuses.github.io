<p>After displaying a pomp and flourish collection, the exhibit presents an overview of the creative process and hard work involved in this fashion industry. In a different room are exposed drawing tables, tracing papers, sketches and sewing machines. A black curtain separates the little room from a long and narrow white hall. The hall displays various massively produced clothing.</p>

<p>On the clothes are attached pieces of paper on which sentences are written.  Each sentences express protest against <a class="zem_slink" title="Mass production" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">mass production</a> and mass consumption. The exhibit highlights issues on ethics and labor, stereotypes, ideals of beauty. Messages are short, clear and powerful. Overall, the Wing Luke Museum Exhibit "Fashion: workroom to runaway" offers an engaging and educative experience.</p>
