<p><strong><a href="http://musesseattle.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/img_4804.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-534 aligncenter" title="Muses" src="assets/img_4804.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="282" /></a>Welcome to our new blog "muses"!<br />
</strong></p>
<p>In Greek mythology, the muses were renowned goddesses of literature, science, and the arts.  They served as a source of inspiration to all artists.  Likewise, we are embarking on a journey in creative design that will be inspired by refugee women in Seattle and their traditional cultures.</p>
<p>Our exciting new endeavor<strong> muses</strong> is a social entrepreneurship aimed at providing professional opportunities and raising funds for Seattle-based refugees through the means of sustainable, ethical fashion.</p>
<p>In this blog-space, we would like to discuss various aspects relevant to this project.  One week, you may find facts, life stories, and events related to refugees’ successes and challenges of resettling in Seattle.  Another week, we may feature stories around sustainable and slow fashion trends.  And of course, we will share updates on the progress of the <strong>muses</strong>project itself.</p>
<p>Through <strong>muses</strong> we together can inspire &amp; impact our community…whether you are a designer, refugee, social advocate, fashionista, or conscious customer.</p>
