## After several months of hard work and thanks to all our donors and supporters, we are pleased to announce that we found a new working space for Muses next apparel production training program!

We will soon be moving into our new apparel production training studio! Moving day will be in a couple of weeks. As we settle in our new SODO location, we are still looking for additional equipment (i.e. additional sewing supplies for students, office furniture, fabrics etc). *If you have any relevant contact or information, do not hesitate to contact us info@seattlemuses.com*. Any donations are welcome! Our apparel production training will start in March. We can't wait to introduce you to our new students and give you updates regarding life in the classroom. We are also planning on organizing a house warming. We are looking forward to welcoming you soon. Thank you all again for your precious help, words of encouragement and support.

More pics, map and other relevant information will be coming soon!
