**Caitlin Cordell** is joining our team this summer as Community Outreach and Program Coordinator. Caitlin is currently an Employment Specialist at a program for out-of-school youth at Shoreline Community College. She teaches job skills and runs an internship program where she places young people at private and non-profit agencies to gain employment experience. Caitlin also supports a small non-profit called All Girl Everything Ultimate Program, which mobilizes youth in South Seattle through the sport of Ultimate Frisbee to become more engaged in issues of social justice. On top of work and volunteering she is also a full-time graduate student working towards getting her Master's Degree in Social Work, with a concentration in Community Centered Integrative Practices.

Caitlin background is mostly in youth and young adult development with an emphasis on leadership, civic engagement, and using creativity and art to inspire social change. She graduated from Oberlin College in 2007 with a degree in Comparative American Studies. Caitlin is passionate about working with multi-cultural grassroots organizations which is why she is so excited to be working with Muses: *"Most of my life I have used art and fashion as a form of self-expression, self-care, and social engagement. I believe that the manufacturing of clothes as well as the social statements that we make with what we wear is incredibly powerful. Muses is the perfect combination of my interests. Bringing together women from immigrant and refugee communities to train them in the garment industry combines my love of working with multi-cultural and undeserved communities, my passion for art and fashion, and my desire to impact the labor industry so that it is more accountable equitable"*.
