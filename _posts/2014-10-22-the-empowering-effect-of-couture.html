    there's no text editor tool, I'll just put things in capital letters! :)\n\nThe
    title is cool!\n\nMary ELEGANTLY revives the art of creating high-quality, handcrafted
    clothing. (if you say gracefully, it refers more to the way she makes things rather
    than was she makes, I feel). \n\nMary brings into life large panel of colorful
    fabrics -->\nMary brings to life large panels of colorful fabrics (...)  chiffon
    AND veil. \n\nNext sentence, remove \"Mary\" and put \"she\"\n\nKenya for three
    years; she BROUGHT WITH her experience and passion for sewing all way TO Seattle.

    b/c it's not clear) girlfriends request (there's an extra space after \"request\").
    \n\nEvery sewing projectS present.\n\ndesigning patterns (don't put \"correct\").\n\n\"Etc\"
    usually makes it very colloquial. If you put it, it's always: \"...etc.\" but
    it sounds like the author was running out of ideas. \nWe usually put \"and such\",
    but since you started your sentence with \"such as\" it doesn't work here. So
    I would put \":\" after challenges and then just \"looking for the right fabric....(...)\"
    so instead of etc, you can put \"complexity of construction, and such.\"\n\nBut
    when it comes to the realization of the garment (comma) such challenges vanish.
    \n\nCompleting a dress is a rewarding experience: Mary is always delighted when
    she witnesses her friends' satisfaction when wearing their new gown: “When I see
    how beautiful and radiant a woman feels while trying on the dress I made for her,
    I’m fulfilled.”\n(the period is at the end of the sentence, the quotation mark
    comes after). \n\nShe had to move to the US and adapt to the changes that were
    occurring in her life. (When? do we have a date? \"a couple years ago\"? \"a couple
    months ago\"? here, it would be nice to have a sense of time). \n\nadjusting TO

    and caring friends through her Church. Mary is now SURROUNDED by a LOVING family
    and community. (repetition of supportive).\n\nSHE recalls her father wearing white
    and neat linen suit. \n\n Mary’s father started his CAREER\n\nThis  genuine daily
    routine (extra space after \"this\") (--> very cool and touching fact!!! But it's
    drowned in too much verbiage). \n\nMary OWES her interest for fashion and design

    \n\n\"Now, she loves working with transparent fabric that gives an elegant and
    floating appearance to a gown. \" That's out of place, we are talking about many
    years ago and then the present is mentioned --> doesn't fit. I would move it or
    get rid of it. \n\nMary has refined TASTES and knows how to enhance voluptuous
    features and CURVES.\n\nTHANKS TO  her GREAT LISTENER'S SKILLS, her patience...\n\nMary
    REMINDS  us that: \n\nThrough her passion, Mary revives this noble profession.
    \n\n\n-------\nI would say that it's a nice article but it's too long. People
    are not going to read that far. Focus on her rather than on the art of sewing
    because the rewarding aspect of the experience is going to be located elsewhere
    on the website, when we talk about refugee women. It is always rewarding, for
    all of them, that is mostly why they like doing it, so we will not repeat it every
    time. \n\nI would also reduce the size of the pictures because they make the article
    pretty hard to read and discontinue the flow of the reading. \n\nFor now, I would
    save but delete the part from \"Sewing is a fine art.\" to \"Completing a dress
    is a rewarding experience.\"\n\nAlso, try to condense the two parts at the beginning
    and after he aforementioned paragraph. They pretty much tell the same thing with
    different words.\n\nRight now it's 600 words! I would definitely try to keep it
    under 400. Otherwise, no one is going to read it unless you use the most touching
    facts at the beginning to keep your reader interested. \nStart your article with
    a quote or something catchy, you're telling a story not just recording information.
    \n\nTry starting with “When I see how beautiful and radiant a woman feels while
    trying on the dress I made for her, I’m fulfilled.” \nIn her cosy little house,
    Mary tells us her story.......blablabla. \n...\nAs a child....\n...\nHer father,
    her aunt...\n...\nWhat she does now. \n\nTouching, informative, efficient. \nI
    think we need to convey more dynamism in the writing as well because some part
    tend to sound to empathetic. It's needs to be more like \"heeeeyyy, she's been
    through touch timesBUT look at this very cool woman that loves doing what she
    does! woohoo! She brings ideas, she's creative, she's motivated and she'll kick
    ass when she sews our designer's orders!\"\nDo you have happier pictures of her?
    The first one is cool but the last one is as if we're talking about someone that
    passed. \n\nYou could maybe try to put all the pictures together at the end, given
    the format of the website for now. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\";}}s:23:\"esther.hong22@gmail.com\";a:1:{i:0;a:2:{s:4:\"time\";s:10:\"1362977304\";s:7:\"content\";s:1258:\"Beautiful

With style and dexterity, Mary brings to life large panels of colorful fabrics such as cotton, chiffon and veil. She studied fashion and design in Nairobi, Kenya for three years.  She brought with her experience and passion for sewing all way to Seattle. In addition to her demanding work as a stay home mom of two little kids, Mary loves taking on new sewing projects that her girlfriends request. She is always delighted when she witnesses her friends' satisfaction when wearing their new gown: “<em>When I see how beautiful and radiant a woman feels while trying on the dress I made for her, I’m fulfilled.</em>”</p>
<p>Life led Mary toward unexpected paths. Ten years ago, she had to move to the US and adapt to the changes that were occurring in her life. In addition to adjusting to her new social role as a mother, Mary had to learn how to fit into a new cultural environment. She eventually met supportive and caring friends through her church.  Mary is now surrounded by a loving family and community.  Despite changing and troubling times, sewing has always been a consistent element of her life.</p>
<p>See bellow samples of Mary's last project: upcycled t-shirt and skirt with traditional fabric from Burkina Faso. The result is stunning!</p>

<p>Mary found her inspiration through her father. “<i>My father had an amazing sense of elegance.” </i>She recalls her father wearing white and neat linen suits. What she also took from her father was his tenacity and his ambition. Mary’s father started his career as an elementary school bus driver. While waiting for the classes to end, Mary's father used to stand behind the window of the classroom to listen to the teacher's lecture. This genuine daily routine helped him build his own education. After years of hard work and determination, he became the mayor of his city.  “<em>My father always told m e to hold on to my dreams. He wanted me to believe in myself</em>.” Mary owes her interest for fashion and design to her aunt. She was a professional designer, pattern maker, tailor and dressmaker. When she was a child, Mary remembers admiring the elegant and extravagant outfits that her aunt would always wear for family events. Mary became a professional herself.  She has refined tastes and knows how to flatter the natural curves of a woman's body. Thanks to her great listening skills, patience and determination, Mary can create a dress that matches someone's personality and style.</p>
<p>Sewing is a fine art. It teaches people listening skills, patience, tenacity, creativity and bravery. Each pieces created by Mary mirrors her perseverance, her diligence and tidiness. Every sewing projects present some sort of challenges: looking for the right fabrics, designing patterns that will marry perfectly unique body shapes, handling the complexity of construction, and such. But when it comes to the realization of the garment, such challenges vanished.</p>
<p>Warmth, elegance, color, transparency are all the elements that you can find in Mary’s world of couture. Mary reminds us that: creating, embellishing and restoring are all the attributes that characterize the art of sewing . Through her passion, Mary revives a noble profession.</p>
