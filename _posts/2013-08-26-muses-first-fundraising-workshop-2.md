On Saturday August 25th, Muses launched its first fundraising workshop. 100% of proceeds will benefits Muses' program and training. Thanks to all our participants for their contributions!

From 9am to 2pm, participants learned how to create a pencil skirt that fits them perfectly. Guided by our experienced instructor, Pennie Laird, they learned how to take measurements and create block pattern. Participants developed basic blocks using personal measurements to enable a more accurate fit. They will be using these blocks again and again to create different styles while avoiding many alterations.

Additional workshops are coming soon. We will keep you posted!
