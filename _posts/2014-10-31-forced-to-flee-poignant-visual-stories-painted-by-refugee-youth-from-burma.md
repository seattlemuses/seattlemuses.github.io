> I dream of a world where poor villagers are considered as worthy of human rights as wealthy people in cities..If I were the president of Burma I will teach soldiers how to become peacemakers..

This is the voice of a young boy from Burma. Thousand of youth from Burma face persecution, oppression and violence. Their personal stories and hopes need to be voiced.

Our dear former mentor Dan and his wife Erika are publishing poignant illustrations in their book *Forced to Flee*. *Forced to Flee* illustrates that the emotions conveyed and evoked by a single narrative image can tell a story of a thousand words, open hearts and build bridges of understanding. In this book, refugee youth harness the power of narrative art to personalize human rights issues and promote a just and inclusive peace in Burma.

They need support to publish the full-color book with over 200 images telling the history and story of the struggles that impact so many children. Checkout their Kickstarter campaign, and support a cause that is worth it!
