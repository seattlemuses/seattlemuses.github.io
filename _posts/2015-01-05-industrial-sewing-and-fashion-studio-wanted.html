<h2>Bellow Muses's first Studio.  We liked our first sewing studio but we are now looking for a bigger space. We haven't found the ideal studio yet. We need your help!</h2>
<h3><a href="/assets/muses-2013-studio (1).jpg"><img class="  wp-image-1594 aligncenter" src="/assets/muses-2013-studio (1).jpg" alt="Muses 2013 Studio" width="448" height="448" /></a>We are looking for a 900 ft<sup>2</sup> to 1,500 ft<sup>2</sup> working/industrial sewing space that could welcome 10 to 15 students. We will have industrial machines, cutting tables, roll of fabrics etc. We are looking for a space with natural light, clean and safe.</h3>

<h4><strong>Location accessibility: </strong>Close to bus or light rail. South Seattle, anywhere from International District to Tukwila.</h4>
<h4><strong>Electricity/power:</strong> We are going to use industrial machines (5/10 maximum), so we need a room with accessible outlets.</h4>
