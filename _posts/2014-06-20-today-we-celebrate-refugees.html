<p>Today is <strong>World Refugee Day</strong>, an annual day of commemoration set aside to celebrate the strength and resilience of refugee communities, recognize the current struggles faced by refugee populations and educate people around the world about refugee issues and how they can help displaced populations. The number of people displaced by violent conflict hit the highest level since World War II at the end of 2013. Pushed up dramatically by the war in Syria, the total number of people displaced by violence reached <strong>more than 51 million</strong> at the end of 2013, according to the agency’s annual <a title="Global Trends report (PDF)." href="http://www.unhcr.org/5399a14f9.html">Global Trends report.</a></p>
