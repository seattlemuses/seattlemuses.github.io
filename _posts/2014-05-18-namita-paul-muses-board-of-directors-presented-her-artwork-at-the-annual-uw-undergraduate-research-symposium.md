**Winter 2014, Namita Paul**

The Muses team would like to congratulate Namita for her hard work. This is also an opportunity for us to celebrate the art of creation. Thanks to designers, "makers" of all goods, amateurs or professionals artists, for bringing fantasy and poetry in our everyday life!

> Give to barrows, trays, and pans..Grace and glimmer of romance; 
> Bring the moonlight into noon..Hid in gleaming piles of stone; 
> On the city's paved street..Plant gardens lined with lilac sweet; 
> Let spouting fountains cool the air, Singing in the sun-baked square; 
> Let statue, picture, park, and hall, Ballad, flag, and festival, 
> The past restore, the day adorn, And make each morrow a new morn. 
> So shall the drudge in dusty frock Spy behind the city clock 
> Retinues of airy kings, Skirts of angels, starry wings, 
> His fathers shining in bright fables, His children fed at heavenly tables. 
> 'T is the privilege of Art..Thus to play its cheerful part..
>
> ..Ralph Waldo Emerson
