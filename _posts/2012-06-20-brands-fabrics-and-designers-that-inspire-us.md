> As individuals we want to remind ourselves that our consuming choices matter. We want to have further opportunities to consume products that are aligned to our values; the ones that care about the environment and advocate for workers' rights. Behind the beautiful designs, shapes and fabrics accessible to us, we are looking for more transparency. We want to envision collaborative and conscious efforts between entrepreneurs, founders, craftsmen, producers and consumers.

Colorful, meaningful, willful, careful mark the brands, fabrics and designers that inspire us. We would like to share some of our favorite eco-friendly and ethical fashion trends.

## Designer
+ **WHO:** [Kristina Constantine.](http://kristinaconstantine.com/designer.html)

In 1989, ethnic violence forced her family to flee their home and spend fifteen years living as refugees in various countries throughout central Eurasia. At 18, she enrolled in National Institute of Design in Moscow. After her family resettled in the US, she graduated magna cum laude from Parsons in 2009 with a second bachelor's degree in fashion design. Kristina was awarded an honorable mention award in CFDA (Council of Fashion Designers of America) student competition and Critic's Choice award. In 2010, she founded Kristina Constantine, Inc. with one goal: to spend her life building America's first philanthropic fashion house dedicated to raising money and awareness to aid the millions of refugees still searching for homes around the world.

The Bottletop gives people the opportunity to earn an income in developing countries and support the wider community through the Bottletop Foundation, ensuring a longer lasting and more sustainable impact. The Social Studio is a dynamic space where clothing is created from recycled and excess manufacturing materials. The Social Studio employs young people from the refugee community in Melbourne.

The Bottletop uses recycled materials such as ring pulls to design appealing and ethical accessories. The project provides job opportunities and sexual health educational training to young people. The Social Studio helps youth to get jobs in retail and hospitality. We had a chance to meet in person Grace McQuilten Founder of the Social Studio. Grace is such a bright, brave and diligent woman!
