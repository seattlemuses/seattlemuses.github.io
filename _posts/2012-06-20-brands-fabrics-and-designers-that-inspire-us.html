<p><em><strong>As individuals we want to remind ourselves that our consuming choices matter. We want to have further opportunities to consume products that are aligned to our values; the ones that care about the environment and advocate for workers' rights. Behind the beautiful designs, shapes and fabrics accessible to us, we are looking for more transparency.  We want to envision collaborative and conscious efforts between entrepreneurs, founders, craftsmen, producers and consumers.</strong></em></p>

<li style="text-align:left;"><strong>WHAT:</strong> Kristina Constantine was born to Armenian parents in Baku, Azerbaijan. In 1989, ethnic violence forced her family to flee their home and spend fifteen years living as refugees in various countries throughout central Eurasia.  At 18, she enrolled in National Institute of Design in Moscow.  After her family resettled in the US, she graduated magna cum laude from Parsons in 2009 with a second bachelor’s degree in fashion design. Kristina was awarded an honorable mention award in CFDA (Council of Fashion Designers of America) student competition and Critic’s Choice award. In 2010, she founded Kristina Constantine, Inc. with one goal: to spend her life building America’s first philanthropic fashion house dedicated to raising money and awareness to aid the millions of refugees still searching for homes around the world.</li>
