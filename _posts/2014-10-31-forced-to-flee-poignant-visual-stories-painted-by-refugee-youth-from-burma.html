<p>"<em>I dream of a world where poor villagers are considered as worthy of human rights as wealthy people in cities..If I were the president of Burma I will teach soldiers how to become peacemakers..</em>" this is the voice of a young boy from Burma. Thousand of youth from Burma face persecution, oppression and violence. Their personal stories and hopes need to be voiced.</p>
<p>Our dear former mentor Dan and his wife Erika are publishing poignant illustrations in their book "<strong>Forced to Flee</strong>". <em>Forced to Flee</em> illustrates that the emotions conveyed and evoked by a single narrative image can tell a story of a thousand words, open hearts and build bridges of understanding. In this book, refugee youth harness the power of narrative art to personalize human rights issues and promote a just and inclusive peace in Burma.</p>
<p>They needÂ  support to publish the full-color book with over 200 images telling the history and story of the struggles that impact so many children. Checkout their Kickstarter campaign, and support a cause that is worth it!</p>
