<p>During the week of September 13th, 2014, <a href="http://www.welcomingamerica.org/" target="_blank">Welcoming America</a> and its partners across the country will host National Welcoming Week, a nationwide event that will bring together immigrants and U.S.-born community members in a spirit of unity through service projects and other events across the country. Diversity is growing among our communities. All around the world people are moving in and out of their native lands. As Stephen Fotopulos, Director of Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition (T.I.R.R.C.), pointed out "<em>embracing diversity means recognizing its economic, cultural and social benefits..it's a sign of great promise and prosperity if your community is the place they choose to invest their talents, raise family and build a new life". </em> If the growth of cultural diversity enriches the local culture and economy, it also challenges policymakers, businessmen and social service providers to successfully integrate the newcomers into a mutually beneficial community. The path to multicultural prosperity is still challenging and stressful. By celebrating and promoting The National Welcoming Week, Muses wants to promote mutual respect and cooperation between foreign-born and U.S.-born Americans. Muses welcomes "Welcoming America"'s initiative and joins forces to spread the word.</p>
