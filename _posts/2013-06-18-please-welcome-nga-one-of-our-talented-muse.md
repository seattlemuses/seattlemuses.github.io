The Muses Team  met with Nga a couple of weeks ago and was charmed by her delightful personality. Nga is originally from Vietnam and recently arrived in the US.  Beside daily challenges that she still need to overcome, such as navigating a new system or learning a new language,  Nga feels at home in Seattle. She has a lot of experience as a tailor and dressmaker and has been sewing for many years. Nga wants to upgrade her knowledge and acquire the skills required to follow a career in the US fashion industry. Muses is excited to provide Nga with the opportunity to further develop her talents and professional skills.
