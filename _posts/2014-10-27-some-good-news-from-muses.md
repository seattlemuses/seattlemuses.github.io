Dear friends, these last months have been extremely busy for Muses team. It was well worth the effort though. We have great news to share with you. These last 10 months we have been working really hard on building a complementary team and on developing a new curriculum to launch our full-scale apparel training program in 2015...and well, here it is! After recently welcoming our new teammates Caitlin (Community Outreach and Fundraising Coordinator) and Kelly (Program Development Director) we are now really excited to introduce our new Director of Training & Production Christine Tsui!

Christine joins Muses with dual qualifications in both the fashion industry and working with low-income immigrant populations. She worked as a technical designer for 25+ years at various places including Nordstrom, Eddie Bauer, and Jarbo. Then, she bravely decided to switch careers and now works as a Licensed mental health counselor for low-income immigrants and refugees at ACRS. Christine is a wonderful person to work with. Currently, Christine is working on building up our curriculum for 2015...and she will also be the one leading most of our new classes. We are very excited to have her on board.

Beginning 2015, we will be launching our full-scale Apparel Production Training Program! For this to come true **we are still looking for a beautiful 1,500 sq-ft studio, ideally located in South Seattle. We are also actively looking for used industrial sewing machines and other sewing equipments (cutting tables, drafting tools etc.).** If you have advice, connections or if you know vacant spaces in South King County let us know here: info@seattlemuses.com . **Thank you for your help!**

**One more news:** Muses' board members, teammates and other supporters are joining forces to prepare the launch our first online fundraising campaign in November! So please stay tune! The best is yet to come!
