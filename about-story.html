      Here in Seattle many good things happen over a fine cup of coffee, and the creation 
      of Muses was no exception. Back in early 2012, we (Sandrine and Esther) met for the 
      first time at Vivace in Capitol Hill.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Our journeys up to that point differed. Sandrine had extensive experience within the 
    non-profit world, whereas Esther had spent all her professional life in the for-profit 
    sector. Sandrine hails from France close to the Alps, and Esther is an American-born 
    Korean who grew up in Austria.

    <p>
    But we connected over a shared <span class="fore-purple"><em><strong>passion</strong></em></span>...
    </p>

    <p>
    Amongst the sounds of espresso machines and chatter we shared our experiences working 
    with the refugee communities in Seattle. We had seen the great skills, experiences, 
    and fierce determination displayed by many of the refugees we met. Yet, they still 
    struggled to find valuable employment due to language barriers, non-transferrable 
    professional certificates, and a lack of knowledge in navigating the US job market. Not 
    only was this adverse for the refugees, it also was for our local economy. We were 
    missing out on a talented workforce.

<p>
We thought <span class="fore-orange"><em><strong>surely</strong></em></span> there must be a better way...
</p>

<p>
We wanted to create ways to better equip low-income immigrant and refugee women with 
the valuable skills demanded in the market place and then provide pathways for employment. Through research and interviewing, we learned that there was a strong need for local, low volume apparel production amongst designers.
</p>

<p>
And so <span class="fore-green"><em><strong>Muses</strong></em></span> was born...
</p>

<p>
In Greek mythology, the muses were renowned goddesses serving as a source of inspiration 
to all artists. Likewise, we are embarking on a journey inspired by Seattle's low-income 
immigrant and refugee women and their stories of extreme trauma, courage, resilience, 
and hope.
</p>

<p>
Coming from immigrant backgrounds ourselves, Muses means a lot to us on a personal 
level. We are incredibly excited and determined to apply our varied skills and 
experiences towards one common passion.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
We hope you join us for this adventure.
