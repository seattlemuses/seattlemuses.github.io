              <p>
              I am from the south of France, from a town close to the Alps and Provence. 
              After several years of working as a case worker and an HR consultant, I moved 
              to the US to work on the promotion of the Young Entrepreneurship Initiative 
              program (YEI) at the French Consulate in Boston.
              </p>
              <p>
              A year later, however, my life took a new direction.
              </p>
              <p>
              I moved to Seattle and completed an MPA with a focus on public policies, global 
              development issues, and NPO management. While volunteering for an organization 
              in charge of implementing Project SOAR (Strengthening Organizations Assisting 
              Refugees), I realized the complex challenges in meeting professional, social and 
              financial needs of newly arrived refugees, which inspired me to look into 
              innovative solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
              I met with a young designer, who started a sewing studio in Capitol Hill and 
              our conversation sparked some ideas on how to better value refugees’ talents 
              and skills.
              </p>
              <div class="team-story-title">my muses</div>
              <p>
              I believe that social entrepreneurship can lead to great innovative solutions 
              for our communities. While dedicating my time to a meaningful cause, Muses 
              gives me the opportunity to meet with inspirational people.
              </p>
              <p>My muses are the 
              individuals I am lucky enough to meet here and abroad. With each person comes 
              an opportunity to discover new cultures, to hear personal stories, to understand 
              different beliefs, and individual hopes, disappointments and perspectives.

              After growing up in Austria and living all over the US, I have found a new home 
              in Seattle.
              </p>
              <p>
              Over my years with General Electric (GE) Aviation, I have worked in various 
              capacities: design engineer, project manager, recruiter, and customer relations 
              spanning the Marine Corps to Boeing. I am certified in Six Sigma and experienced 
              with lean manufacturing.
              </p>
              <p>
              Since 2010, I have volunteered with refugees in job application and interview 
              training, resume writing, and family mentoring. Their incredible resilience and 
              courage have always touched me. While I do not know what it’s like being forced 
              to flee your home, I do know first-hand the many practical and emotional 
              challenges of adjusting to a new culture and language. A big advocate for social 
              entrepreneurship, I started exploring ways to better match their skills with the 
              existing demands in the consumer market leading me to Muses.

              My parents, immigrants from Korea, are my inspiration. They embody characteristics 
              that I deeply respect, particularly a desire to continuously learn new things...
              to never settle for what is comfortable.
              </p>
              <p>My dad always told me as a child that 
              “adventure is scary, but fun” (something he perhaps regretted after I drove their 
              car into our neighbor’s new fence at the age of 8). As I get older and hopefully 
              a little wiser, this phrase takes on new meaning to me, reminding me to never let 
              fear get in the way of stepping into the unknown.

              I was born in China and raised in Hong Kong.  I have lived in Seattle for over 20 years.  I am a fashion
              industry veteran with over 25 years of experience working as a Technical Designer for Seattle-based 
              fashion companies Nordstrom, Eddie Bauer, and Jarbo.  Previously I worked in Hong Kong as a Product 
	      Merchandiser.
              </p>
              <p>
              A few years ago, I took on a new challenge as a second career as a Licensed Mental Health Counselor.  
	      Through the ACRS (Asian Counseling and Referral Service), I provide counseling and social work services
	      to mostly low-income Asian immigrants and refugees.  I see very intimately how cultural & linguistic barriers,
              medical challenges, and lack of professional training hinder them in navigating the job market.  My vision 
	      is to apply all my experience and skills from both my fashion and social work backgrounds towards 
              building job training for people who desire to work in the fashion industry.

              I am inspired by expressions of beauty in all things around us and in nature. I am also inspired 
              by people’s inner strength, resilience, perseverance and creativity. I love working with people, 
              hearing their stories and connecting with their authentic selves. I believe everyone is a genius 
              in their own way. Helping people discover their genius, helps me find mine.

              <p>
              I was born in British Columbia and came of age in the Deep South. My always-adventurous father was in the habit of saying to his four daughters and wife, “Hey, girls, how’d you like to move to ______?” That sentence always ended with his most recent travel quest. We were a bit stunned when Alabama actually stuck, and we moved from one end of the continent to the other. He had two laser-like goals: to fulfill his promise of putting his four daughters through college and to run the best, first racially-integrated medical clinic in Perry County, Alabama.
              </p>
              <p>
              I stayed in the South to study and then headed to the Berkshires to teach struggling students at a quirky boarding school. I have drifted from the classroom but always focused on education initiatives for students with considerable barriers to success. In the past two decades, I’ve worked with big foundations, governmental departments, and school developers on major reform strategies, all aimed at helping students prep for and succeed at college and in careers.
              </p>
              <p>
              I am most proud of the work I’ve done with my husband to form a nonprofit focused on issues of access here in our adopted hometown of Seattle. We Will Find a Way works with businesses to eliminate physical barriers for people with limited mobility.

              My muses have always been teachers. I come from a long line of them. Tough teachers. Dedicated teachers. Teachers who put the needs of their students first. It is a rare and wonderful thing to watch a master teacher work, and I have had the good fortune of being taught by many. I see myself as just trying to return the favor.

              I am a native Seattleite with over 10 years experience in program development and implementation. 
              I currently working on my Masters Degree in Social Work with a concentration in Community Centered 
              Integrative Practices. My work has primarily been with high risk youth and young adults. I helped 
              build Girls in Motion - an experiential, self expression and movement based after-school program 
              in Ohio for middle school girls. In 2009 I founded the program YMakeArt, an entrepreneurial art 
              program for alternative high school youth run through the YMCA. In 2011 after three years as the 
              Leadership Development Coordinator for the Dale Turner Y, I took a position at Shoreline Community 
              College as the Employment Specialist for an out-of-school youth reengagement program called Learning 
              Center North.
              </p>
              <p>
              Currently, I partner with Community Based Organizations (CBO) to provide valuable work 
              experiences to our students in various fields.

              Because I am from the PNW, my muses are primarily from here. The people that inspire me are my 
              friends who do amazing things in community around social justice (ArtsCorps, YouthSpeaks, FEEST, 
              Social Justice Fund, Washington Bus, All Girl Everything Ultimate Program). Some individual friends 
              who are my muses right now are: Amy Benson (Director of The Girl Who Knew Too Much), Karen Finnyfrock 
              (author of The Sweet Revenge of Celia Door), Annie Von Essen (Founder of Vessel Strategy & Consulting, LLC). 
              Places that inspire me are the Frye Art Museum, the Seattle skyline, scenic hot springs, my backyard, and 
              sitting at coffee shops.
