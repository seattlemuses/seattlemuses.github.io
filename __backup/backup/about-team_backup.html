              <p>
              I am from the south of France, from a town close to the Alps and Provence. 
              After several years of working as a case worker and an HR consultant, I moved 
              to the US to work on the promotion of the Young Entrepreneurship Initiative 
              program (YEI) at the French Consulate in Boston.
              </p>
              <p>
              A year later, however, my life took a new direction.
              </p>
              <p>
              I moved to Seattle and completed an MPA with a focus on public policies, global 
              development issues, and NPO management. While volunteering for an organization 
              in charge of implementing Project SOAR (Strengthening Organizations Assisting 
              Refugees), I realized the complex challenges in meeting professional, social and 
              financial needs of newly arrived refugees, which inspired me to look into 
              innovative solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
              I met with a young designer, who started a sewing studio in Capitol Hill and 
              our conversation sparked some ideas on how to better value refugees’ talents 
              and skills.
              </p>
              <div class="team-story-title">my muses</div>
              <p>
              I believe that social entrepreneurship can lead to great innovative solutions 
              for our communities. While dedicating my time to a meaningful cause, Muses 
              gives me the opportunity to meet with inspirational people.
              </p>
              <p>My muses are the 
              individuals I am lucky enough to meet here and abroad. With each person comes 
              an opportunity to discover new cultures, to hear personal stories, to understand 
              different beliefs, and individual hopes, disappointments and perspectives.

              After growing up in Austria and living all over the US, I have found a new home 
              in Seattle.
              </p>
              <p>
              Over my years with General Electric (GE) Aviation, I have worked in various 
              capacities: design engineer, project manager, recruiter, and customer relations 
              spanning the Marine Corps to Boeing. I am certified in Six Sigma and experienced 
              with lean manufacturing.
              </p>
              <p>
              Since 2010, I have volunteered with refugees in job application and interview 
              training, resume writing, and family mentoring. Their incredible resilience and 
              courage have always touched me. While I do not know what it’s like being forced 
              to flee your home, I do know first-hand the many practical and emotional 
              challenges of adjusting to a new culture and language. A big advocate for social 
              entrepreneurship, I started exploring ways to better match their skills with the 
              existing demands in the consumer market leading me to Muses.

              <p>
              My parents, immigrants from Korea, are my inspiration. They embody characteristics 
              that I deeply respect, particularly a desire to continuously learn new things...
              to never settle for what is comfortable.
              </p>
              <p>My dad always told me as a child that 
              “adventure is scary, but fun” (something he perhaps regretted after I drove their 
              car into our neighbor’s new fence at the age of 8). As I get older and hopefully 
              a little wiser, this phrase takes on new meaning to me, reminding me to never let 
              fear get in the way of stepping into the unknown.

              I was born in China and raised in Hong Kong.  I have lived in Seattle for over 20 years.  I am a fashion
              industry veteran with over 25 years of experience working as a Technical Designer for Seattle-based 
              fashion companies Nordstrom, Eddie Bauer, and Jarbo.  Previously I worked in Hong Kong as a Product 
	      Merchandiser.
              </p>
              <p>
              A few years ago, I took on a new challenge as a second career as a Licensed Mental Health Counselor.  
	      Through the ACRS (Asian Counseling and Referral Service), I provide counseling and social work services
	      to mostly low-income Asian immigrants and refugees.  I see very intimately how cultural & linguistic barriers,
              medical challenges, and lack of professional training hinder them in navigating the job market.  My vision 
	      is to apply all my experience and skills from both my fashion and social work backgrounds towards 
              building job training for people who desire to work in the fashion industry.

              hearing their stories and connecting with their authentic selves. I believe everyone is a genius 
              in their own way. Helping people discover their genius, helps me find mine.

              I grew up in Denver, Colorado where I first discovered the power of supported and transitional job 
              training to create a bridge toward social and economic integration. This discovery took place for 
              me in high school while teaching computer skills and ESL to trainees at a social enterprise that 
              employed impoverished women as they learned to overcome barriers to traditional employment. While 
              professionally I have had a variety of roles in education and public health, I repeatedly find myself 
              drawn to initiatives and organizations that accelerate the achievement of social equity and expand 
              access to opportunity. 
              </p>
              <p>
              For me, Muses lives at the intersection of a commitment to work toward a broad, 
              inclusive economy and society that I have been developing over my lifetime, and a more recent interest 
              in responsible apparel production.

              My daughters are absolutely my muses. They inspire me to help create the world I want them and their 
              sisters across the globe to grow up in. And, they demonstrate the incredible “pay it forward” force 
              that is activated by investing in and supporting individuals, particularly in ways that open new 
              horizons for them. I want them to know they can aim high for themselves and others.

              I am a native Seattleite with over 10 years experience in program development and implementation. 
              I currently working on my Masters Degree in Social Work with a concentration in Community Centered 
              Integrative Practices. My work has primarily been with high risk youth and young adults. I helped 
              build Girls in Motion - an experiential, self expression and movement based after-school program 
              in Ohio for middle school girls. In 2009 I founded the program YMakeArt, an entrepreneurial art 
              program for alternative high school youth run through the YMCA. In 2011 after three years as the 
              Leadership Development Coordinator for the Dale Turner Y, I took a position at Shoreline Community 
              College as the Employment Specialist for an out-of-school youth reengagement program called Learning 
              Center North.
              </p>
              <p>
              Currently, I partner with Community Based Organizations (CBO) to provide valuable work 
              experiences to our students in various fields.

              Because I am from the PNW, my muses are primarily from here. The people that inspire me are my 
              friends who do amazing things in community around social justice (ArtsCorps, YouthSpeaks, FEEST, 
              Social Justice Fund, Washington Bus, All Girl Everything Ultimate Program). Some individual friends 
              who are my muses right now are: Amy Benson (Director of The Girl Who Knew Too Much), Karen Finnyfrock 
              (author of The Sweet Revenge of Celia Door), Annie Von Essen (Founder of Vessel Strategy & Consulting, LLC). 
              Places that inspire me are the Frye Art Museum, the Seattle skyline, scenic hot springs, my backyard, and 
              sitting at coffee shops.
