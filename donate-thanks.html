  Thank you for your generous donation to Muses: Conscious Fashion Studio.

  <p>
  With your gift, you are investing in immigrant and refugee communities to build valuable careers and break the cycle of financial hardship.  And you are helping equip them with the skills to be a key piece to the renewed wave of local, ethical apparel manufacturing in the US.  We are pretty excited about this and hope you are too!
