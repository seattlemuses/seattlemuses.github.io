    "The Muses program has been a great opportunity to learn hands-on pattern making and sewing from a very skillful and wonderful teacher who really cares about our progress, along with the dedicated staff who are supporting us to succeed both inside and outside the classroom. For immigrant women, many of whom can't speak English, there are not many opportunities to learn these intricate details of making clothes and gain employment without being exploited. But we are being taught the essential tools and getting experience in a socially conscious environment. My time here has been very precious so far. As an immigrant woman I'm beginning to see many possibilities for myself, and day after day I'm accepting myself as someone capable who can definitely achieve her dreams along with people cheering for me." - Yuki
